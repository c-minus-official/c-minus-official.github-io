        <div class="description">
            The C-Minus team is proud to be working with Roblox® Exploit and Script developers to enhance the coding experience, providing sleek and fast updates, amazing syntax, and best user support by our passionate team which consists of: Tux, Tzerb, and Games44.
            <br><br>
            Our journey began with the development of major exploits: WinSploit, a sleek exploiting tool, and Lapetus: An undetected exploit under a franchise which owned Lapetus Anti-Cheat, which have now ceased to exist. We played a key role in giving these methods to Roblox, but now it's time to bounce back, and show everyone who we are.
            <br><br>
            We are glad to announce our stay, regards, C-Minus team
